      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>Finding Funding opportunities is extremely difficult, especially when every business, large and small are looking. The PPP Loan (which offered 
        $349 billion) ran out of money in 13 days! This money was sucked up by larger businesses (ie: NBA and Shake Shack) who weren't in as dire of a 
        situation as smaller businesses. These small mom-and-pop shops are closing it's doors at staggering rates because they can't make enough. Roughly
        9 million small businesses are at risk. And what they need is income and support!!!
