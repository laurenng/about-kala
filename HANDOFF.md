**Note our project folder & Google Drive are associated with our UW student emails which expire after our graduation, therefore it is recommended that these documents are saved elsewhere and backup accordingly.**

## Project Description

Funding Finder is the capstone project created by Team kala, a group of UW Informatics majors, and sponsored by the Washington State Department of Commerce. Our objective with Funding Finder was to create the infrastructure for an online platform in which small businesses can become more knowledgeable and resilient by connecting them with resources and funding opportunities.

Said platform consists the following:
- A website where small businesses can be matched with appropriate technical assistance providers and funding opportunities and access other online resources to build financial literacy.
- A website that acts as a content management system for the database of funding opportunities and technical assistance. Said information can be created, updated, and deleted by those with proper access to the system
- An API that connects the database to the main Funding Finder website

We made Funding Finder with a focus on supporting Tribal and Native American owned businesses first with hopes to expand the target demographic after our involvement.

## Features & Ideas We Didn't Have Enough Time For

As with any project, time and resources are limited, therefore meaning we had many ideas we couldn't fit into our project. We have aggregated them here in the hopes that they will be implemented in the future or be used as something the team this project is being handed off to can reference for further ideation.
